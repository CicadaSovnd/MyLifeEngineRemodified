# MyLifeEngineRemodified
A direct copy (with features imagined by AI and I) of the game (The) Life Engine by Max Robinson (MaxRobinsonTheGreat). I initially tried to copy the source files directly from Github and brute force it into the browser with AI. I know nothing about coding. Somehow I'm making this. Google Gemini can see the source code and made this for browser.
